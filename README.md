# migrate_generator
Module to generate migrations based on source CSV files

# Deprecation notice

This module has been moved to https://www.drupal.org/project/migrate_generator

Do not use this repo anymore

## Basic idea

Main idea here is to **automatically generate migration config based on source csv files**.

------------
## Drush command

`drush migrate_generator:generate_migrations %arg %options`

Where %arg - absolute path to directory with source .csv files. All source files should be placed there without any subfolders.

Also we have next possible options:
* pattern -
  Pattern for source CSV files. Defaults to '*.csv'.
* delimiter -
  Delimiter for source CSV files. Defaults to ;
* enclosure -
  Enclosure for source CSV files. Defaults to "
* values_delimiter -
  Delimiter for multi-valued fields. Defaults to |
* date_format -
  Date format used in CSV. Defaults to "d-m-Y H:i:s"
* update -
  Update previously-generated migrations.
* migrate_group -
  Migration Group Id. Defaults to "migrate_generator_group"

This command creates Migration for each source file and Migration Group for these created migrations.
Migration group ID can be specified by **migrate_group** option in drush command.

## CSV file structure and contents

We should use next ways of organizing source files:
* Source CSV files should have following filename pattern `{entity_type}-{bundle}.csv` or `{entity_type}.csv`.

  You can see some examples in /example folder of this module, like `node-basic_page.csv`, `taxonomy_term-category.csv`, `user.csv`, etc.

**Main idea here - to identify target Entity type and Bundle for source file.**

There are some rules for structure and content of source csv file:
* Each source file should have first column filled with Ids. It will be used as unique identifier for source row only, not for Id of migrated entity.
* All other columns should be named with exact field's machine name.
* For boolean fields you can use "1/0" or "true/false" values.
* For list fields, we should have key values in source csv, not labels.
* Fields with multiple values should have strict delimiter. `|` for example.

  This delimiter can be specified by **values_delimiter** option in drush command.
* Date fields should have same date format everywhere in sources.

  This date format can be specified by **date_format** option in drush command.

  No timezone conversion is made for dates.

## Complex fields with multiple properties

For complex fields like Formatted text, Link, Datetime Range, Address, Price, we can have several properties in source file.
In this case, you can use `/` separator in column name for these cases.

Supported complex field types:
  - **formatted text** (we can use format and value properties)
  - **link** (we can use uri and title properties)
  - **datetime_range** (we can use value and end_value properties)
  - **address** (we can use various properties like country_code, locality, postal_code, etc.)
  - **price** (we can use number and currency_code properties)

For example, `body/value`, `body/format`, `date/value`, `date/end_value`, `price/number`, `price/currency_code`, etc.

Any other complex field type also could work this way.
It is not guaranteed, but you can extend this functionality writing own GeneratorProcessPlugin.

## File and Image fields

For file migration, we could have 2 possible cases:
  - we have absolute filepath in csv
  - we have URLs in csv

* For `absolute` case, you'd have absolute filepaths to files in csv.

  These files will be copied to Drupal filesystem into folder, named by field name.

* For `external` case, you'd have URLs to external files in csv.

  These files will be downloaded to Drupal filesystem into folder, named by field name.

## Reference fields support

References is most complicated part here, as we should have migration dependencies for them

**For all reference fields, we should have Id from corresponding source as field value.**

For example, in `category` column in content source csv, you'd have Id of this term and term source should have row with this Id in its source file.
in node-basic_page.csv:

...| category |...|
---| --- | --- |
...| 12 | ... |

and in taxonomy_term-category.csv :

| id | name |
| --- | --- |
| 12 | test category |

Also we could have some complicated cases, when we have multiple dependencies.
For example:
1. Paragraph field in Basic Page CT could have references to WYSIWYG and Media paragraphs.
so we will have separate sources for these paragraphs `paragraph-media.csv`, `paragraph-wysiwyg.csv`

2. Media paragraph could have references to Image media and Document media.
so we will have separate media sources here too `media-document.csv`, `media-image.csv`
